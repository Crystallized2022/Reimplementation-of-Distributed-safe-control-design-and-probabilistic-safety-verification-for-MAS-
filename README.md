# Reimplementation-of-Distributed-safe-control-design-and-probabilistic-safety-verification-for-MAS-
Reimplementation of the paper: "Distributed safe control design and probabilistic safety verification for MAS", specifically the first part.
Arvix link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12610
The implementation is done in MATLAB. It is still quite fiddly, so if you have any ideas, please contact me.
